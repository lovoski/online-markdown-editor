# Brief Introduction to the App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Deployed on github pages with [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages). The markdown preview and editing features are powered by [Vditor](https://b3log.org/vditor/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`
Deploy an updated version of app to destinated `homepage` written in `package.json`. Detailed information about using `gh-pages` can be found in [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-app-to-github-pages/).

### `npm start`
Start a local server and experiment the feature.
